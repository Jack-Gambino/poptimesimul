What to do after downloading the poptimesimul directory from github:

[1]
- unzip it 
- run RStudio and set the working directory to the above 
  (Session > Set Working Directory)
- in the Files tab, go into the R subdirectory (you should see directories
  called analyze, doc, etc.
- load makepop.R and set L <- 1 (the default is value of L is 120)
- Source makepop.R to create a population file
- in the Files tab go back up one directory and enter the analyze directory
- load analyze.R
- step through it line by line to get to know the population

Read QuickStart.pdf in the doc directory. When you have time,
read poptimesimul_article.pdf in the same directory.

[3] Re-do [1] with L <- 120 and analyze_time_series.R
